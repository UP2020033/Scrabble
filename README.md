# Key features

The user can drag and drop tiles onto the main board.
Once the tiles are dragged onto the main board, the user must press play in order to get a score for the placed word.
If the word is a valid word, a score will be given.
The score is given based on the number of letters that make up the word.
If the user wants to replace the non-placed tiles, they must drag the tiles back into the bottom tile rack and press the 'Skip' button. Which will generate 7 new tiles.
